# E Stop Monitor "Unknown" Status Fix

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: E Stop monitor was showing "Unknown" status for all E Stops instead of reading actual PLC tag values.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Incorrect Tag Reading Logic**: The E Stop monitor was using a different approach to read PLC tags compared to the working PLC validation script.

2. **Missing Import**: The enhanced toolkit wasn't importing the `estop_monitor` module, causing it to fall back to mock implementations.

3. **Inconsistent Tag Handling**: The E Stop monitor was trying to read individual tags instead of using the same batch reading approach as the PLC validation script.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated E Stop Monitor Tag Reading Logic
**File**: `estop_monitor.py`

**Before**: The monitor was trying to read individual tags using a complex mapping system.

**After**: Updated `read_current_states()` method to use the exact same approach as the PLC validation script:

```python
def read_current_states(self) -> Dict[str, EStopStatus]:
    """Read current E Stop states from PLC using the same approach as PLC validation"""
    try:
        # Use the same SAFETY_TAGS list as the PLC validation script
        safety_tags = [
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SafetyIO.In.ESTOP_Relay1Feedback',
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineBackLeftESTOP.ChannelA',
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineBackLeftESTOP.ChannelB',
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineBackRightESTOP.ChannelA',
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineBackRightESTOP.ChannelB',
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineFrontESTOP.ChannelA',
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineFrontESTOP.ChannelB',
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MainEnclosureESTOP.ChannelA',
            'Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MainEnclosureESTOP.ChannelB',
        ]
        
        # Read all safety tags at once (same as PLC validation script)
        with self.plc_connection_manager.get_connection() as plc:
            results = plc.Read(safety_tags)
            
            if isinstance(results, list):
                # Process results using the same logic as PLC validation
                for tag, result in zip(safety_tags, results):
                    # Map to E Stop ID and channel, then update state
                    # ... (processing logic)
```

### 2. Added Missing Import
**File**: `spp_toolkit_enhanced.py`

**Before**: The enhanced toolkit wasn't importing the E Stop monitor module.

**After**: Added the import to ensure the real E Stop monitor is used:

```python
try:
    from config import config
    from logger import get_logger, ProgressLogger
    from network_validation import NetworkValidator, DeviceResult
    from plc_communication import EnhancedPLCValidator
    from estop_monitor import EStopMonitor, EStopStateChange  # Added this line
    from cognex_validation import CognexValidator, CognexDevice, CognexResult
    # ... other imports
    ENHANCED_MODULES_AVAILABLE = True
```

### 3. Enhanced Mock Fallback
**File**: `spp_toolkit_enhanced.py`

Added proper mock classes for E Stop monitoring in the fallback section to ensure the application doesn't crash when enhanced modules aren't available.

### 4. Fixed Configuration Integration
**File**: `config.py`

Added the missing `EStopConfig` class and integrated it into the main configuration system.

## Verification

### Test Results
All tests now pass successfully:

```
✅ E Stop Integration: PASS
✅ PLC Validator Integration: PASS  
✅ Configuration: PASS
```

### E Stop Definitions Confirmed
The system now properly monitors these exact tags as specified:

1. `Program:SafetyProgram.SafetyIO.In.ESTOP_Relay1Feedback` (Single channel)
2. `Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineBackLeftESTOP.ChannelA` (Dual channel A)
3. `Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineBackLeftESTOP.ChannelB` (Dual channel B)
4. `Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineBackRightESTOP.ChannelA` (Dual channel A)
5. `Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineBackRightESTOP.ChannelB` (Dual channel B)
6. `Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineFrontESTOP.ChannelA` (Dual channel A)
7. `Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MachineFrontESTOP.ChannelB` (Dual channel B)
8. `Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MainEnclosureESTOP.ChannelA` (Dual channel A)
9. `Program:SafetyProgram.SDIN_MainEnclosureESTOP.ChannelB` (Dual channel B)

## How It Works Now

### Tag Reading Process
1. **Batch Reading**: All 9 E Stop tags are read in a single `plc.Read()` call, just like the PLC validation script
2. **Result Processing**: Each tag result is mapped to the appropriate E Stop ID and channel
3. **State Conversion**: Boolean PLC values are converted to E Stop states (True = ACTIVE, False = INACTIVE)
4. **Change Detection**: State changes are detected and logged with timestamps and duration information

### Dual-Channel Logic
For dual-channel E Stops (Back Left, Back Right, Front, Main Enclosure):
- **Overall State**: ACTIVE if either Channel A OR Channel B is ACTIVE
- **Overall State**: INACTIVE only if both channels are INACTIVE
- **Individual Tracking**: Each channel is tracked separately for detailed monitoring

### Single-Channel Logic
For single-channel E Stops (Relay Feedback):
- **Direct Mapping**: PLC value directly maps to E Stop state

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- All E Stops showed "Unknown" status
- No state changes were detected
- Monitoring was non-functional

### After Fix
- E Stops show actual PLC values (ACTIVE/INACTIVE)
- Real-time state change detection works
- Individual E Stop monitoring functions correctly
- Dual-channel E Stops show both channel states
- State change history is properly tracked

## Usage Instructions

1. **Launch the Enhanced Toolkit**
2. **Go to E Stop Monitor Tab** (Ctrl+E)
3. **Enter PLC IP Address** (default: 11.200.0.10)
4. **Click "Get Status"** to see current E Stop states
5. **Click "Start Monitoring"** to begin real-time monitoring
6. **Watch for State Changes** in the log area
7. **Use "Generate Report"** for detailed status information
8. **Use "Export Changes"** to save state change history

The E Stop monitoring system now uses the same reliable tag reading approach as the working PLC validation script, ensuring consistent and accurate E Stop state detection.
